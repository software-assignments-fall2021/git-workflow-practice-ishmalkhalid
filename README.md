### How AI Will Transform Software Development

### Summary

Some might believe that AI may be able to replace the need for software developers soon but according to the aforementioned article, that still seems to be a few years away. This is particularly really interesting to me because recently I learned about OpenAI Codex which is able to translate natural language into code pretty accurately which made me wonder if software developers will still be needed in the industry.

This article shows that software engineers will infact be needed more now with the increasing use of AI in almost every aspect of software development to effectively work with AI and execute different activities. The role may look different but as 80% of busineeses are investing in AI, software developers will use it to obtain new knowledge, optimize procedures and ultimately produce better code using AI rather than being replaced by AI.
